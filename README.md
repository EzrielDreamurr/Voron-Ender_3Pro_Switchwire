# Voron-Ender_3Pro_Switchwire_OPEN_BETA
Conversion of the Ender 3 pro to a switch wire and its mods.
This is a full conversion of the popular Ender 3 Pro/V2 to a Voron Switchwire. This conversion was inspired by [walttriano](https://github.com/walttriano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire)AKA @DaRk_dOg and [boubounokefalos](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW). However, like boubounokefalos's design, almost everything was re-designed for a better rigidity and improved some reliability issues based on my personal experience. And designed a new enclosure with a easier accessing working area and featured a new custom bed and complete kit that is available on my [website](https://www.golemdesignhk.com/shop-1)(i rather recieve DM on discord for now) that also supports the original [Voron Switchwire](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Switchwire), the original Ender3 heated bed and a custom mic6 build plate. I also reduced the amount of MGN12H Linear Rails from 5 to 4, reducing one rails from the Y axis and suprisingly increased the reliability. printing volume is ~220x235x220 which remains unchanged.
