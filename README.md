# Voron-Ender_3Pro_Switchwire_Pre_release
Conversion of the Ender 3 pro to a switch wire and its mods.
This is a full conversion of the popular Ender 3 Pro/V2 to a Voron Switchwire. This conversion was inspired by [boubounokefalos](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW) AKA @DaRk_dOg and [walttriano](https://github.com/walttriano/Ender_3Pro_Switchwire). 
The skirts and the original SW componets remained mostly unchanged as they worked fine, thanks to DD & Voron team's amazing design. I modified the motor mounts and some idlers for a better rigidity and improved some reliability issues based on my personal experience. And modified the enclosure for rigidity and featured a new custom bed and complete kit that is available on my [website](https://www.golemdesignhk.com/shop-1)(i rather recieve DM on discord for now) that also supports the original [Voron Switchwire](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Switchwire), the original Ender3 heated bed and a custom mic6 build plate. I also reduced the amount of MGN12H Linear Rails from 5 to 4, reducing one rails from the Y axis and suprisingly increased the reliability. printing volume is ~220x235x220 which remains unchanged.
